## Summary of Work Today

### 1. CSS Troubleshooting and Style Loading Issues

- Encountered a puzzling issue where CSS styles for headings and paragraphs were not applying as expected.
- In Chrome DevTools, many CSS rules appeared **struck through** or **greyed out**, causing confusion.
- Initial suspicion was about CSS specificity or !important overrides.
- It was discovered that a **grayscale filter and opacity on the background pseudo-element (`#main-page::before`)** was causing the text styles to appear visually muted or overridden.
- After **commenting out or adjusting the grayscale filter**, the styles began showing correctly.
- The real fix emerged by **trial-and-error** and **incremental tweaking**, changing colors directly in DevTools and seeing the live response.
- Key lesson: Sometimes complex CSS interactions (filters, opacity, pseudo-elements) can block visual updates, and experimentation with dev tools is essential.

### 2. HTML Structure Review and Cleanup

- Cleaned and corrected HTML nesting for the landing page and main page wrappers.
- Introduced a `.main-intro-text` wrapper div to group the landing page header, paragraph, and enter button for easier styling and positioning.
- Fixed several structural problems caused by automatic editor (IDE) insertion and misplaced closing tags.

### 3. Positioning and Styling Text Elements on Main Page

- Discussed and adjusted positions of key textual elements:
  - Centered the `<h2>` and introductory paragraph at the top with increased width and font weight.
  - Moved the first `.service-card` ("Brand Identity") up and slightly left for asymmetry and to follow a natural arc layout concept.
  - Left the "Web Design" card unchanged as it was already ideally positioned.
  - Moved the "Illustration" card far right with margin adjustments, keeping vertical alignment consistent.
- Added letter-spacing and line separators to improve readability and breathing room, especially for headers.
- Targeted only paragraphs inside `.service-card` elements for style adjustments, excluding intro paragraphs outside the section.

### 4. Design Discussion on Transition Animations and Layout Philosophy

- Reaffirmed overarching design principles:
  - **Organic & expressive** layout with overlap, asymmetry, and playfulness.
  - Most important design principle is **"edit"** — refining and paring down to essentials.
- Considered expanding the landing-to-main page fade transition into full-screen transitions between service “pages” triggered by hovering service cards.
- Discussed desired smoothness and fullscreen nature of transitions to keep user fully engaged.
- Posed questions about content density, visual continuity, return UI style, background treatment, and interaction behaviors for these transitions.

## Lessons Learned & Recommendations

- CSS layering with filters and pseudo-elements can mask styles visually even if technically applied. Always check visual effects as potential culprits.
- Use DevTools extensively to experiment live; direct editing in the inspector can quickly reveal effective style changes.
- Clear and logical HTML structure is critical to smooth styling and scripting. Watch out for IDE auto-insertions or misplaced tags that break layouts.
- Design-wise, breaking away from strict grid or box models opens room for organic and expressive layouts but requires precise position tuning (margins, flexbox tweaks).
- Transitions should be designed holistically — consider animation timing, easing, and how to keep user orientation during full-screen shifts.

## Next Steps

- Let the design ideas percolate overnight for the transition system and service page layouts.
- Plan the exact content and interaction details for service-specific full-screen pages.
- After that, proceed with coding and implementing the seamless fade transitions for service card hover states.
- Continue refining typography and spacing for maximum legibility and visual harmony.
